                    <p class="article-text">At a press conference today, President Donald Trump dispensed one clear piece of medical advice to American parents in a rambling, repetitive monologue. Don't take Tylenol. He told pregnant women that they could help keep their children safe from autism by not taking the drug whenever they could avoid it ("fight like hell," he instructed). He advised parents not to give Tylenol to their young children.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">He discouraged giving the hepatitis B vaccine to infants and suggested that parents space out their children's immunization schedule. "They pump so much stuff into these beautiful little babies, it's a disgrace," he said. He declared that children ideally should be given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines separately, though such individual shots are not available in the United States. "This is based on what I feel," the president said.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">Trump had been hinting at his big announcement for weeks, and it was evident that he wasn't interested in making sure the claims had passed through the normal research process. "I don't want to wait any longer. We don't need anything more. And if it's wrong—it's not going to be wrong, but—if it is wrong, it's fine. We have to do it," Trump told the audience at a forum for the American Conservative Institute on Saturday.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">The announcement marks a significant departure from established medical consensus. Major health organizations, including the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have consistently stated that acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safe when used as directed during pregnancy and that there is no proven link between the medication and autism.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">Medical experts quickly responded to Trump's statements with concern. Dr. Sarah Chen, a pediatric neurologist at Johns Hopkins, emphasized that "spreading misinformation about vaccines and common medications can have serious public health consequences. Parents should consult with their healthcare providers, not politicians, for medical advice."</p>

                    <p class="article-text">This is not the first time Trump has waded into medical controversies. Throughout his political career, he has questioned vaccine safety, promoted unproven treatments, and contradicted public health officials on various issues. His latest statements come as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, has been given a prominent role in what Trump calls the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) initiative.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">The timing of these remarks is particularly concerning to public health advocates, as vaccination rates have been declining in some communities across the United States. Measles outbreaks, once thought to be eliminated in the U.S., have resurged in recent years in areas with low vaccination coverage.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">Trump's suggestion that parents should avoid giving Tylenol to pregnant women and young children contradicts decades of medical practice. Acetaminophen has been considered one of the safest pain relievers for use during pregnancy and is often the only option recommended by doctors for pregnant women experiencing pain or fever.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">The president's comments about spacing out childhood vaccines also runs counter to the CDC's recommended immunization schedule, which has been carefully designed to protect children when they are most vulnerable to serious diseases. Delaying vaccines can leave children unprotected during critical periods of their development.</p>

                    <p class="article-text">As this story continues to develop, medical professionals are urging parents to rely on evidence-based medical advice from qualified healthcare providers rather than political figures when making decisions about their children's health.</p>
